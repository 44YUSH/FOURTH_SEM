/*

This benchmarking application measures the time taken to execute CPU-bound and memory-bound workloads. To optimize garbage collection settings, you would need to enable 
garbage collection logging in the JVM and analyze the logs generated during benchmark runs. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Enable GC Logging**: Start the JVM with the appropriate GC logging flags, such as `-verbose:gc`, `-Xloggc:<filename>`, and `-XX:+PrintGCDetails`.

{ JVM is a JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE that enables the execution of Java bytecode. The JVM acts as an interpreter between the Java programming language and the underlying hardware.
  It provides a runtime environment for Java applications to run on different platforms and operating systems. }

2. **Run Benchmark**: Execute the benchmarking application multiple times with different workload types.

3. **Analyze GC Logs**: Examine the GC logs generated during benchmark runs to understand GC behavior, including pause times, frequency of collections, heap usage, and 
other relevant metrics.

4. **Optimize GC Settings**: Based on the analysis of GC logs, adjust GC settings such as heap size, GC algorithm (e.g., G1, CMS, Parallel), GC tuning options 
(`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis`, `-XX:ParallelGCThreads`), and other relevant parameters to improve garbage collection performance.

5. **Re-run Benchmark**: After optimizing GC settings, re-run the benchmarking application to evaluate the impact of the changes on garbage collection performance.

6. **Iterate**: Iterate on the optimization process by fine-tuning GC settings further based on the results of each benchmark run.

By following these steps, you can develop a simple benchmarking application to measure garbage collection performance and optimize garbage collection settings for 
better performance under different workloads.
